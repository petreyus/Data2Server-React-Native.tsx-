# React-Native-Application
React Native: Sending data to/from Node.js(Express.js) Server:

1: Change the IP address to your localhost (don't use localhost since if youre testing on your mobile device it will not connect).

2: expo start (once you cd to correct folder).

2: Run on web browser. 

Note: to access on your mobile device use the tunnel option on expo and copy the link on your device.

Watch as your data moves from your react application to your Node.js (using express) server and back again!!!
