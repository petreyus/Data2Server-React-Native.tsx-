# React-Native-Application: Breathing app
Current problem solved: sending data to and from a server.
Next problem to be solved: changing background images seemlessly on IOS devices.



React Native: Sending data to/from Node.js(Express.js) Server:

1: Change the IP address to your localhost. 
        ^NOTE: don't use 'localhost' since if youre testing on your mobile device it will refer to itself and then not connect).

2: Expo start (once you cd to the correct folder).

3: Start server.tsx via Node

2: Run on web browser option on Expo after it has started.              
        ^NOTE: to access on your mobile device use the tunnel option on expo and copy the link on your device.

Watch as your data moves from my react application to the Node.js (using express) server and back again!

Final NOTE: check out the branches to see newer changes that I am currently devloping.
