<h1> React Native: Sending data to/from Node.js(Express.js) Server:</h1>

1: Change the IP address to your localhost. 
       * ^NOTE: don't use 'localhost' since if youre testing on your mobile device it will refer to itself and then not connect).*

2: Expo start (once you cd to the correct folder).

3: Start server.tsx via Node.

2: Run on web browser option on Expo after it has built.              
        *^NOTE: to access on your mobile device use the tunnel option on expo and copy the link on your device.*

Be astounded as your data moves from the react application to the Node.js (using express) server and back.
